      <h1><u>Reflection</u></h1>
      <h2>of My Learning Journey & Web Development</h2>
      <div class="information">
        <p>
          I feel that my web development skills have progressed immensely. At the start of the year, I didn't even know what HTML meant. Little did I know, I would discover the language that all good websites use and how to speak the language myself. Things I liked about web development this year are things like how we already had a ready-made template, the website design that I ended up with, etc. I think that Replit is very easy to use and also very reliable. I've learnt a lot of skills involving HTML, CSS, and other stuff.<br><br>
          In general, I think my website's pretty neat in my opinion. I believe that there are some things that I can improve, but I don't really know what. The embeds, GIFs, and buttons all work as intended, so that's good I guess. I chose this color aesthetic because they are my favorite colors: red, black, and white. Overall, I think that I have done a decent enough job to showcase the things that I have created and learnt on my website over the last 26 weeks.<br><br>
          Well this is it. 26 weeks of educational learning, about to be put into 10 weeks of hard work during school hours and (probably, hopefully not) losing sleep at home. For this project, I've decided to work with <a href="https://owasisis.github.io/O.K-10DGT-BHS-Website/" target="_blank" class="owaiskhan-link">Owais Khan</a> as we have created a strong bond between us in mostly DGT, but also in other subjects.<br><br>
          As I am writing this, or should I say typing this, at 0046 hours, 14/09/2024, we are currently in the researching and brainstorming phase of our final project; the first main part of the whole thing. At the time being, we are fairly certain that our project will be centered around 3D modelling and potentially animating. We are both relatively skilled and experienced when it comes to softwares such as Blender or Fusion 360, leaving us with somewhat good determination and commitment to a project that we will be working on together for the next 10 weeks.
