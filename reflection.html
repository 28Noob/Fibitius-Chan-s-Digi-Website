        <p>
            I feel that my web development skills have progressed immensely. At the start of the year, I didn't even know what HTML meant. Little did I know, I would discover the language that all good websites use and how to speak the language myself. Things I liked about web development this year are things like how we already had a ready made template, the website design that I ended up with, etc. I think that Replit is very easy to use and also very reliable. I've learnt a lot of skills involving HTML, CSS and other stuff.<br><br>
            In general, I think my website looks quite cool in my opinion. I believe that there are some things that I can improve it, but I don't really know what. The embeds, GIFs and buttons all work as intended. I chose this colour aesthetic because they are my favourite colours: red, black and white.
          Overall, I think that I have done a decent enough job to showcase the things that I have created and learnt on my website over the last 26 weeks. I am willing to take a challenge in the form of an end of year final project.
